    History
    The city’s nucleus was a settlement around a mud fort, built in 1537 by a local chief, Kempe Gowda. The fort was reconstructed of stone in 1761. Bangalore was the headquarters of the British administration from 1831 to 1881, when the raja was restored. However, Britain retained an administrative and military presence in the city until Indian independence in 1947. Bangalore subsequently became the capital of the new state of Mysore and remained the capital during the reorganization of states in 1956; Mysore was renamed Karnataka in 1973.</p>

    <p class="parasizing">The people of Chennai are very proud of their culture. They are fiercely protective of their local language, Tamil, and many would rather prefer communicating in Tamil than in any other language. Even the important holidays and festivals celebrated in Chennai are different from those celebrated in the rest of India. The culture is definitely what Chennai is famous for.Jallikattu is an inseparable part of Tamil culture and tradition. This sport of taming the bull has been organised and played for ages, and every year locals participate in bullfighting with fierce enthusiasm. The festival began during the Tamil classical period and since then has flourished.

        Today, despite a few controversies, Jallikattu is celebrated all over Chennai with pomp and show. For the festival, special Bos indicus bulls are bred and used. Jallikattu is so popular that it even has its own premier league called the Jallikattu Premier League</p>
